# Nonlinear Inversion for 1-D Crustal Velocity Structure Using Cross-Convolution of Teleseismic Waveforms
Here only added the 7 layer and half space test 
We used Central US Model CUS.mod -> SCM.mod to generate synthetic earth response using the scripts

hrftn96, a program of Computer Program in Seismology (Herrmann, 2013) is used to generate synthetic seismograms
